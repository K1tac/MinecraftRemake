# GUIDELINES FOR CONTRIBUTION
## To Minecraft Remake

We’re excited to have you contribute to Minecraft Remake! Whether you're fixing bugs, suggesting features, or helping improve the overall code quality, your contributions are welcome. Please follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth process.

### 1. **Fork the Repository**
   - Begin by forking the repository to your own GitHub account. This allows you to make changes without affecting the main project until you're ready.
   - Once you’ve forked it, clone the repository to your local machine using:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/minecraft-remake.git
     ```

### 2. **Create a New Branch**
   - Before making any changes, create a new branch for your feature or bug fix. This keeps your work organized and separate from the `main` branch.
   - Use a clear and descriptive name for the branch, such as `fix-player-movement` or `add-new-block`.
     ```bash
     git checkout -b your-branch-name
     ```

### 3. **Make Your Changes**
   - Now, make your changes! Whether it's fixing bugs, adding features, or improving the codebase, make sure to:
     - Write clear, understandable code.
     - Follow existing code style conventions.
     - If adding new features, make sure they're well-documented.
     - Test your changes locally to ensure everything works as expected.

### 4. **Commit Your Changes**
   - After making your changes, commit them to your branch. Write a clear commit message describing what you’ve done. For example:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Fix player jumping bug"
     ```

### 5. **Push Your Changes**
   - Push your changes to your forked repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin your-branch-name
     ```

### 6. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**
   - Head to the repository’s GitHub page and click on the “Pull Requests” tab. Then click "New Pull Request."
   - Select your branch and compare it to the `main` branch of the original repository.
   - Provide a description of your changes in the PR, including the problem it solves and why it’s needed.
   - Once the PR is ready, click "Create Pull Request."

### 7. **Review and Collaboration**
   - Once you submit your PR, it will be reviewed by the project maintainers. Be open to feedback and make any necessary changes.
   - If your contribution is approved, it will be merged into the main repository.

### 8. **Coding Standards**
   - **Code style**: Follow the general coding style of the project. Keep your code clean, readable, and well-commented where necessary.
   - **Indentation**: Use 2 spaces for indentation.
   - **Variable naming**: Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables and functions.

### 9. **Bug Reporting**
   - If you encounter any bugs, feel free to report them by creating a new issue on the GitHub repository.
   - Be specific about how to reproduce the bug and provide any relevant details like browser, operating system, etc.

### 10. **Feature Requests**
   - Have an idea for a new feature? Please open an issue and describe the feature in detail. If it’s a major feature, it’s always good to discuss it before starting the implementation.
