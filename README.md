# Minecraft REMAKE

Welcome to Minecraft REMAKE built with **Three.js**! This project is a simple 3D world where you can explore blocks, jump around, and interact with the environment. The goal is to create a Minecraft-inspired game using web technologies.

## Features
- **Voxel-based terrain**: Simple cube-based world.
- **Player movement**: Walk, look around, and jump.
- **Basic physics**: Gravity and collision detection.
- **Crosshair**: A central crosshair for aiming and focus.
- **Block Placement / Block Destruction**: You can destroy or place blocks like the real Minecraft.
- **Terrain Generation**: As you walk around the world, terrain is generated automatically.
